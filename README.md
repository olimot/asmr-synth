## 2. Usage

1. **Play / Stop Button:**
   - Press the PLAY button to start generating ASMR sounds.
   - Press it again to stop the sound.
2. **Whisper Mode:**
   - Toggle the WHISPER switch to change the voice to a whisper without adjusting the volume.
   - This mode creates a softer, more soothing ASMR effect by using a whispering sound instead of a regular speaking voice.
3. **Voice Frequency (VOICE FREQ):**
   - Adjust the VOICE FREQ slider to control the frequency of the ASMR voice.
   - A higher frequency produces a higher pitch, while a lower frequency produces a deeper sound.
4. **Speed:**
   - The PACE slider controls the speaking rate and the movement speed of the sound source.
   - Increasing the pace will result in a faster speaking tempo and quicker movement, creating a dynamic, immersive ASMR experience.
5. **Range:**
   - The RANGE slider adjusts the area within which the sound source can randomly move.
   - Increasing this setting allows the sound to travel across a wider space, adding variation in the perceived location of the sound for a more engaging ASMR experience.
